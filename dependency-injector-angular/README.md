##Â Dependency Injection (https://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection)

- All Providers of Eager Modules are merged into one - root injector
- Lazy Modules have its own injector (exist hierarchy)
  - Check any provider locally (own injector) if it is not found check it in the root injector
  - A new instance is created for any provider in the LazyModule
  - In order to share a lazy load service with the rest of the modules you need to register it as part of the root injector (forRoot). Other way around is to get it from the child injector once the lazy module is loaded (or if it is a component you need to create it dynamically)
